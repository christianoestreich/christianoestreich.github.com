  <div class="entry-content"><p>Based on a request from a user to add user defined logging and fault
interceptors, I have enhanced the <a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/cxf-client" title="Grails Cxf Client Plugin">Grails cxf-client plugin</a>. I have
included these features in the new release version 1.2.3.</p>

<p>In the previous version (1.2.2) of the plugin I added the ability to override
the security interceptor. This was done to allow users to diverge from using
the standard WSS4J interceptor that I bundled with the plugin. I accomplished
this by adding an single out interceptor to the cxf client proxy.</p>

<p>In the latest version I have taken the interceptor injection one step further
and allowed users to configure any number of in, out or fault out interceptors
they want to add to the interceptor chain. Â In addition I have provided a flag
to turn on or off the default logging in and out interceptors that I am auto
injecting for the users.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">Recently with my [cxf-client][1] plugin I wanted to give users a way to inject
custom beans into the auto-wired client services. At first I was having a
little trouble figuring out how to get each configured service to have a
uniquely injected security interceptor. Burt Beckwith does something similar
with the [spring-security-core][2] plugin. I borrowed heavily on his method
for using [filters][3].

The key to getting this working was knowing that the service client factory I
use is a singleton as are each unique instance of the service that is
configured. Given the way I have the apache cxf code wrapped, any clients
created hand off their actual creation of the service proxy to the service
client factory. The security interceptor that is injected to the client has
to be a unique bean as it will be wired up as a singleton as well and be
handed off to the factory during creation. What this ultimately means is that
I can&#8217;t just have one global property that can be overridden by a common bean
name as this would be shared across clients and not give each client the
flexibility to define it&#8217;s own unique security interceptor property values
such as username and password

python and posted it on <a href="https://gist.github.com/1329319">github gist</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content">I am happy to announce that I have released the version 1.0 of the cxf client
plugin.Â  The plugin can be found here:Â  [http://grails.org/plugin/cxf-
client][1].

There are a few different plugins for consuming SOAP web services with grails,
but none currently deal with the issue of caching port references. The ws-
client plugin works, but its limitations are in how it creates and consumes
the wsdl. It relies on real time creation of proxy classes and services which
can be very processor and memory (time) consuming with a large or complex
service contract. We need a way to speed up service invocation so this plugin
was created to facilitate that need when consuming SOAP services using cxf.

The Cxf Client plugin will allow you to use existing (or new) apache cxf
wsdl2java generated content and cache the port reference to speed up your soap
service end point invocations through an easy configuration driven mechanism.

A big thanks to Brett Borchardt and Stefan Armbruster for helping out with the
plugin coding/review and the wsdl2java script.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently at a monthly <a href="http://devjam.com/" title="DevJam">DevJam</a> meeting <a href="http://naleid.com/blog/" title="Ted Naleid">Ted Naleid</a> presented on the
topic of <a href="http://redis.io/" title="Redis">Redis</a> and how its use as a data store and cache. Â I was
intrigued and wanted to delve into Redis more as a semi-persistent data store.
I came across the <a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/redis" title="Redis GORM">Redis GORM plugin</a> that allows you to persist POGOs
directly to Redis via normal GORM operations. Â With the release of <a href="http://www.grails.org/blog/view/admin/Grails+1.4.0.M1+is+now+available">Grails
1.4.0 M1</a>, there have been some changes to the default persistent data
store from HSQL to an <a href="http://www.h2database.com/html/main.html" title="H2 Database">H2 database</a>. Â I wondered just how much faster
read/write operations could be with Redis (if at all) over the H2 database so
I set out to write a little test app to see for myself.</p>

<p>I am not going to get into the specifics of the jQuery widget I wrote to do
this, how to configure it or theÂ semanticsÂ on how/why I chose to use the
deferred object, but please grab the code and have a look at that stuff too.</p>

<p>The source code for this prototype is available at
<a href="https://github.com/ctoestreich/redis-gorm">https://github.com/ctoestreich/redis-gorm</a>.</p>

<h2>Getting Redis</h2>

<p>The first thing I needed to do was download the windows port of Redis from
<a href="https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads">https://github.com/dmajkic/redis/downloads</a>. Â I downloaded version 2.2.5
and edited the following lines in the 32bit (or 64bit) redis.conf file:</p>

<p>Uncomment/change the following line (probably a good idea to always have a PW
on any persistent stores) <em>requirepass a1s2d3f4qwert!</em></p>

<p>You can start redis now while we get the project running</p>

<p><a href="http://www.christianoestreich.com/wp-"><img src="http://www.christianoestreich.com/wp-" alt="" /></a></p>

<h2>Running Grails</h2>

<p>For this particular task I decided to use Grails 1.4.0 M1. Â It was a bit
different than 1.3.7 in getting the client setup working well with the newly
integrated resources plugin. Â I assumed that the wiring would be a little more
automatic, and it was, but I was still required to manually add the
r:resources and the jqui tags. Â I also had a bit of an issue with IntelliJ
10.5 not recognizing the Grails 1.4.0 M1 as a valid SDK. Â I basically ended up
coding all the stuff old school in textpad (so forgive any non-static analysis
friendly code).</p>

<p>I installed the <a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/redis" title="Grails Redis GORM">Grails Redis GORM</a> plugin which allows you to add the
following line and expose normal Gorm operations against Redis.</p>

<pre><code>static mapWith = "redis"
</code></pre>

<p>My objects were pretty simple and consisted of the following nearly identical
code.</p>

<pre><code>class RedisObject {

  static mapWith = "redis"

  String name

  List someList

  static mapping = {

    name(index:true)

  }

}


class GormObject {

  String name

<p>I also added the following to the Config.groovy to get Grails talking to Redis</p>

<pre><code>grails.redis.host="localhost"

grails.redis.port=6379

grails.redis.password="a1s2d3f4qwert!"

grails.redis.pooled=true

grails.redis.resources=15

grails.redis.timeout=5000
</code></pre>

<p>With your grails home and path set to recognize Grails 1.4.0 M1, start the
server up.</p>

<pre><code>grails run-app
</code></pre>

<p>After starting the server navigate toÂ <a href="http://localhost:8080/redis-gorm/dataTest/index" title="local site">http://localhost:8080/redis-
gorm/dataTest/index</a></p>

<h2>Under The Covers</h2>

<p>What is happening under the covers is multiple ajax requests are being
performed for both create/save and retrieve against Redis and H2. Â I am using
Highcharts to render the results for the operations realtime using the jQuery
ajax and deferred libraries. Â Every time both (Redis/H2) requests complete it
doubles (configurable) the number of operations it is trying to perform. Â The
ajax calls return back to the client the time in ms it took to execute the
request number of operation. Â The results will not be graphed until both Redis
and H2 ajax operations have returned results.</p>

<p>Here is a very simplified flow of what is happening:</p>

<p>create widget &ndash;> performTest &ndash;> defer(getRedis, getGorm) &ndash;> both completed &ndash;>
collect results data &ndash;> update graph &ndash;> increase record count &ndash;> start from
performTest again</p>

<p>Here is a snippet of the code used on the controller to conduct the tests. I
would encourage you to browse and download the code from github for more
specifics on the client and server code.</p>

<pre><code>def getGorm = {

    def gorms = []

    def duration = benchmark {

      def count = GormObject.count()

      (1..Integer.parseInt(params?.recordCount ?: "2")).each {

        gorms &lt;&lt; GormObject.findById((Math.random() *
</code></pre>

<p>count).asType(Integer.class))</p>

<pre><code>      }

    }

    println "Gorm found: ${gorms.size()}"

    render text: duration, contentType: "text/plain"

  }

  def getRedis = {

    def redises = []

    def duration = benchmark {

      def count = RedisObject.count()

      (1..Integer.parseInt(params?.recordCount ?: "2")).each {

        redises &lt;&lt; RedisObject.findById((Math.random() *
</code></pre>

<p>count).asType(Integer.class))</p>

<pre><code>      }

      println "Redis found: ${redises.size()}"

    }

    render text: duration, contentType: "text/plain"

  }

  def makeGorm = {

    Integer total = Integer.parseInt(params?.recordCount ?: "100")

    def duration = benchmark {

      (1..total).each {

        new GormObject(name: "GormObject" + it, someList:
</code></pre>

<p>makeListData(10)).save()</p>

<pre><code>      }

    }

    render text: duration, contentType: "text/plain"

  }

  def makeRedis = {

    Integer total = Integer.parseInt(params?.recordCount ?: "100")

    def duration = benchmark {

      (1..total).each {

        new RedisObject(name: "RedisObject" + it, someList:
</code></pre>

<p>makeListData(10)).save()</p>

<pre><code>      }

    }

    render text: duration, contentType: "text/plain"

  }

   private makeListData(count) {

    def listData = []

    (1..count).each {

      listData &lt;&lt; ["listData${it}"]     }     listData   }   private
</code></pre>

<p>benchmark = { closure &ndash;></p>

<pre><code>    def start = System.currentTimeMillis()

    closure.call()

    def now = System.currentTimeMillis()

    now - start

  }
</code></pre>

<p>When invoking the read operation I wanted to grab a random set of results so I
opted to use a random number generator and findByID(rand) to grab single
records as opposed to a list operation. Â There is probably some inherent
overhead in this type of operation as opposed to grabbing a whole list at a
time. Â There is probably a better way to do this, but as the count of records
to retrieve goes up, I was really hoping to see the difference in read
operation time between the two by forcing more reads.</p>

<h2>My Observations</h2>

<p>First I should mention that I haven&rsquo;t collected and analyzed with any detail
specific numbers. Â I have mainly just used the graphical output and results
generated from the controllers as my point of reference. Â I think depending on
the machine the mileage of the tests and results will vary.</p>

<p>Redis is consistently faster on the read operations while the save seems to be
pretty close and H2 keeps pace with Redis. Â The tests do seem to jump around a
bit, but generally speaking Redis read/write operations are faster that those
of H2 running in memory. Â I suppose I expected this result as Redis is best
suited as a key/value store and lacks some of the more robust operations
supported in a product more suited for relational data modeling, but I think
as a simple and fast data store, Redis is more than a viable option.</p>

<h2>Things To Note</h2>

<p>Running the tests more times up to a number like 65k test items without
stopping the server (just refreshing the browser) will help get items into the
databases so there is more objects to randomize against the read operation.</p>

<p>I would like to see these same tests conducted using different criteria-based
and list operations so the db has to do more of the work in joining and
aggregating data on the read operations. Â Maybe next week.</p>

<h2>Sample Output</h2>

<p>The results from this graph show the time in ms it took to process a set
number of records per operation type. Â The script will process them in blocks
of 2,4,8,16,32 and so on until it hits some limit set via the widget. Â Then
the results are graphed for the time to execute 2 saves, 4 saves, 8 saves,
etc. Â The same is true of the read operations graph and test.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I have more research I would like to conduct on this topic by comparing a
physical data store like MySQL against Redis for example. Â I don&rsquo;t have an
immediate need for a simple key/value store or cache at the moment, but I
would love to incorporate Redis into our application stack in the the near
future.</p>
